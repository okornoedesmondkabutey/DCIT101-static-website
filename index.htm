Dr. Nkrumah was overthrown by military government in 1966, after ruling for 9 years. He then went to exile in the Republic of Guinea. He fell ill and died in Bucharest, Romania 1972 when seeking medical treatment.T
Nkrumah's body was buried in Guinea since he was the Co-president there. With Nkrumah dead, the Arican Students Union in London feared that, the total emancipation of Africa has come to a dead end.
The students sent a memo to Guinea asking that the body of the late president should be brought to Ghana only if the then military government would denounce coup d'etat and re-erect the statue of Kwame Nkrumah that was toppled down during the coup. 
This marked the beginning of the Nkrumah Mausoleum Monument.
Till date students go for excursions to go and learn more about this.Foreigners from different countries especially the Great Britain also come to learn more about how their nation colonized Ghana.
